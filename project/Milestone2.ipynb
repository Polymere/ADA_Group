The h5py files each contain the following elements:\n",

    "We extracted each element separately and stored them in keyed RDDs (file_id, data). The two biggest elements are `analysis.segments_pitches` and `analysis.segments_timbre`. They each take 26% of the data size, so the maximum size an RDD can take is 72Go of ram space. Now we can load each RDD individually. If we need multiple elements simultaniously we can join the RDDs, and if the joined RDDs are two big for the cluster we can do some sampling to reduce the size. Loading each element individually is a lot faster now too. This operation is done in the script `src/extract_rdds_from_data.py`. We have only used the script to work on the data locally yet, but as soon as the whole dataset is uncompressed, we will extract the RDDs from the dataset."
