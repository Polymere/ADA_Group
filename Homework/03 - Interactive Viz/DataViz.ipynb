    "In this homework we will be exploring interactive visualization, which is a key ingredient of many successful data visualizations (especially when it comes to infographics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unemployment rates are major economic metrics and a matter of concern for governments around the world. Though its definition may seem straightforward at first glance (usually defined as the number of unemployed people divided by the active population), it can be tricky to define consistently. For example, one must define what exactly unemployed means : looking for a job ? Having declared their unemployment ? Currently without a job ? Should students or recent graduates be included ? We could also wonder what the active population is : everyone in an age category (e.g. `16-64`) ? Anyone interested by finding a job ? Though these questions may seem subtle, they can have a large impact on the interpretation of the results : `3%` unemployment doesn't mean much if we don't know who is included in this percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will be dealing with two different datasets from the statistics offices of the European commission ([eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database)) and the Swiss Confederation ([amstat](https://www.amstat.ch)). They provide a variety of datasets with plenty of information on many different statistics and demographics at their respective scales. Unfortunately, as is often the case is data analysis, these websites are not always straightforward to navigate. They may include a lot of obscure categories, not always be translated into your native language, have strange link structures, â€¦ Navigating this complexity is part of a data scientists' job : you will have to use a few tricks to get the right data for this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the visualization part, install [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) (*HINT*: it is not available in your standard Anaconda environment, therefore search on the Web how to install it easily!). Folium's `README` comes with very clear examples, and links to their own iPython Notebooks -- make good use of this information. For your own convenience, in this same directory you can already find two `.topojson` files, containing the geo-coordinates of \n",
